# How to Push Your Project to GitHub

Since we're having issues with the Git permissions in this Replit environment, here's a simple way to get your code to GitHub:

## Method 1: Using GitHub Desktop (Recommended for beginners)

1. Download the `teacher-backup.zip` file from this Replit workspace
   - Click on the file in the file explorer
   - Use the three-dot menu to select "Download"

2. On your local computer:
   - Extract the ZIP file to a folder
   - Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) if you don't have it already
   - Open GitHub Desktop and log in to your GitHub account
   - Choose "Clone a repository" and select your repository (https://github.com/Foxman-Dev/Teacher.git)
   - Note the local path where it's cloned

3. Copy files from your extracted backup to the cloned repository folder
   - Make sure to preserve the folder structure
   - Use the `teacher-backup` folder as the source

4. In GitHub Desktop:
   - You'll see all the changed files listed
   - Add a commit message like "Add enhanced facial expression analysis with Google Cloud Vision"
   - Click "Commit to main"
   - Click "Push origin" to push to GitHub

## Method 2: Using GitHub Web Interface

1. Download the `teacher-backup.zip` file from Replit
2. Extract it on your computer
3. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/Foxman-Dev/Teacher
4. Navigate into each folder and use the "Add file" > "Upload files" button
5. Drag and drop the corresponding files from your extracted backup
6. Commit each upload with a message

## Method 3: Using Git Command Line

If you're familiar with Git commands:

```bash
# Clone your repository
git clone https://github.com/Foxman-Dev/Teacher.git

# Navigate to the cloned repository
cd Teacher

# Copy files from your extracted backup

# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Add enhanced facial expression analysis with Google Cloud Vision"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

Choose the method that works best for you! Your enhanced educational content platform with Google Cloud Vision facial analysis will now be available in your GitHub repository.
